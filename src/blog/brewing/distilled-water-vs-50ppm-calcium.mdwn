[[!meta title="Distilled Water vs 50ppm Calcium Chloride"]]


This past weekend I brewed twice. Both batches were Jamil's Blonde Ale recipe. 
Both batches were 1 gallon batches&mdash;my first try at those. These batches
were also my first two brews back after an extended hiatus that stemmed from some 
combination of moving, changing jobs, and pure laziness.

In the past, when I brewed more regularly, I had a lot of questions about
brewing chemistry that were never fully answered. Now that I'm making a
return to brewing, I hope to answer some of these questions.

The first question: **Does calcium from water make any difference in finished beer?**

I would like to design an experiment or a series or experiments to investigate
this question. Right now, I'm at the point where I'm grasping, trying to understand
the full scope of the problem.

The two beers I brewed this weekend were designed to understand how to approach
this question: one brewed using only distilled water and one brewed with 50 ppm
calcium added as CaCl<sub>2</sub>.

Prep Work
---

Since I've been out of the game for so long, I had a ton of prep-work to do.

First step: sanitize my 1 gallon fermenters. I opted for dry-heat sterilization.
I accidentally bested the CDC's recommendation for dry-heat sterilization since
my oven is fairly out-of-control :) I held my three glass fermenters at a
temp of 360&deg;F for 1 hour.

![Sterilization](http://tylercipriani.s3.amazonaws.com/distilled_water_brew/prep-sterilization.jpg)

I calibrated my kettle by marking a measuring stick 1-half-gallon at a time.

I also calibrated my pH meter using freshly prepared 7.01 and 4.01 calibration
solution made from powder buffer-pillows.

I opted out of controlling dissolved oxygen this round. Between adopting a
new process, brewing 2 batches in a weekend, and meticulously photographing
each step&mdash;I felt I had enough on my plate.

Process
---

* Brew in a bag (BIAB), 1 gallon, full-boil
* Heat 2 gallons water to 155&deg;F in 3 gallon kettle
* Add crushed grain in 18"x32" large mesh straining bag
* Allow to stabilize at 152&deg;F
* Maintain 152&deg;F for 1 hour
* Boil remaining 1.75 gallons of wort for 60 minutes
* Chill to 65&deg;F
* Rack to sanitized 1 gallon fermenter
* Ferment at 67&deg;F

Batch #1
---

Heated 2 gallons of distilled water to 155&deg;F and doughed-in. Initial strike
was 148&deg;F which I rapidly raised via direct fire to 152&deg;F. I did have
some trouble maintaining 152&deg;F so mash temp ranged from around
148&deg;F&ndash;154&deg;F.

### Mash

Mash pH was 5.77&mdash;which, while predictably higher than desired, was
within what I usually target (5.2&ndash;5.8). I left that pH unadjusted.
Post-mash wort was fairly opaque.
![Post mash opacity](http://tylercipriani.s3.amazonaws.com/distilled_water_brew/Batch1-PreBoil-Clarity.jpg)

**15 minutes into the mash**: iodine test shows conversion, mash tastes more sweet
than starchy.

**30 minutes into the mash**: iodine test _still_ shows conversion. Mash _looks_
like it's finished converting.

**45 minutes**: Yup
**60 minutes**: OK, moving on.

### Boil

* Pre-boil Gravity: 1.042
  ![Batch1 Preboil](http://tylercipriani.s3.amazonaws.com/distilled_water_brew/Batch1-PreBoil.jpg)
* pH 5.76
  ![Batch1 Preboil pH](http://tylercipriani.s3.amazonaws.com/distilled_water_brew/Batch1-PreBoilpH.jpg)

**Notes:**

Pre-boil gravity of 1.042 which is higher than my expected. The wort does
appear to have coagulated some protein at this point.

Added 7 grams of US Fuggles at 60 minutes. Not much visible hot break
during the initial part of the boil.

### Post-boil

* F.G. 1.059
  ![Batch1 FG](http://tylercipriani.s3.amazonaws.com/distilled_water_brew/Batch1-FG.jpg)
* Post-boil pH 5.72
  ![Batch1 pH](http://tylercipriani.s3.amazonaws.com/distilled_water_brew/Batch1-FinalpH.jpg)
**Notes:**

Dropped very clear with a clear break post-boil.
Racked using a sanitized mini-autosiphon. Added 30 seconds of oxygen into
fermenter head-space at the rate of 1 LPM, and shook fermenter 60 seconds.

Batch #2
---

Added 0.70 grams CaCl<sub>2</sub>/gallon into 2 gallons of distilled water
to bring total calcium to 50 ppm. Heated water to 155&deg;F and doughed-in. 
Initial strike was 149&deg;F which I rapidly raised via direct fire to 152&deg;F.

### Mash

* pH 5.53
* Temp: 152&deg;F

![Batch2 Mash](http://tylercipriani.s3.amazonaws.com/distilled_water_brew/Batch2-Mash.jpg)
Mash pH is lower, due to the added calcium. Finding it easier to control mash
temperature with this batch (after some practice). Seems to have more foam
on top of the mash, but that could be my imagination.

**15 minutes into the mash**: iodine test shows conversion, mash _looks_
like it's finished converting. May be lighter than previous batches.

**30 minutes into the mash**: iodine test _once again_ shows conversion.

**45 minutes**: mmhmm
**60 minutes**: yezzur

### Boil

* Pre-boil Gravity: 1.043
* pH 5.54

**Notes:**

The wort is certainly clearer than previous batch. No real change in pH,
once again.

Added 7 grams of US Fuggles at 60 minutes. Very nice visible hot-break.

### Post-boil

* F.G. 1.060
  ![Final Gravity](http://tylercipriani.s3.amazonaws.com/distilled_water_brew/Batch2FG.jpg)
* Post-boil pH 5.49
  ![Final pH](http://tylercipriani.s3.amazonaws.com/distilled_water_brew/Batch2-FinalpH.jpg)

**Notes:**

Dropped very clear with a clear break post-boil.
Racked using a sanitized mini-autosiphon. Added 30 seconds of oxygen into
fermenter head-space at the rate of 1 LPM, and shook fermenter 60 seconds.

Discussion
---

It's odd that neither batch's post-boil pH was very much lower than the mash pH.
I've always read that a beer's pH should drop by ~0.3 pH units during boil.
When this didn't happen during the first (distilled water) batch's boil, I
assumed it had something to do with the missing calcium. That was, evidently,
not the cause.

The only _real_ difference between the two batches is that there was a visibly
better hot-break in the batch with 50 ppm calcium. That and, of course, the
difference in mash pH, which is expected and well-documented.

I'll post again post-fermentation.
